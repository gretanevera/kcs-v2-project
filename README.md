# Escape! THIS REPOSITORY IS INCOMPLETE BECAUSE PROJECT IS BEING WRITTEN with REACT
Slendy game

This project aims to create a browser game that "reacts to players browsing patterns" in the website to determine the flow of the game.

The game requires to... like any other slenderman game... to collect all 8 notes to win. 
The notes appear while player browses the website. Every time a note is found, the player will have less and less time to explore current page for new notes
When the time runs out, slenderman catches you and it's a game over.

 The last page will require some digging to do..
 
 By the way, don't run in circles...
